    "### Known source matching\n",
    "When searching for pulsars, many pulsar-like sources are detected. Some of these may actually be known pulsar sources, and shouldn't be flagged as possible new discoveries. Known source matching compares newly detected candidates to known sources, and attempts to find out if they're duplicates.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "Matching requires a set $K$ of known pulsar sources. These are usually obtained from the ATNF pulsar catalogue (CSIRO, 2012). We define each source in $K$ as $k_{i} = \\lbrace k_{i}^{1}, \\ldots , k_{i}^{m}\\rbrace$. Here each source is a tuple, uniquely identifiable via the index $i$. For all $k_{i}^{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Matching also requires a newly detected candidate $c_{i}\\in C$. Here $c_{i} = \\lbrace c_{i}^{1}, \\ldots , c_{i}^{m}\\rbrace$. For all $c_{i} \\in C$, it holds that $|c_{i}| > 0$ and all $c_{i}^{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The meaning of each $k_{i}^{j}$ is the same as $c_{i}^{j}$ (or at least mappable).  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "A brute force approach compares each $c_{i}$ to every $k_{i} \\in K$. This corresponds to a runtime complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot |K|)$. As new sources are found over time, $|K|$ is increasing. The brute force approach is thus computationally expensive. It's memory complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(|K|)$, as each known source is typically stored in memory for comparison.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "#### On-line source matching\n",
    "We have developed a new algorithm based upon the divide and conquer approach. It recursively divides the matching space, reducing the number of comparisons to be undertaken on each iteration. It relies on an ordering applied over the set $K$. It requires a total ordering of elements in $K$ according to some variable $k_i^j$, under $\\leq$. For all $k_{i}^{j}$, $k_{i+1}^{j}$, and $k_{m}^{j}$, where $m>i+1$,  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "$$\\textrm{if } k_{i}^{j} \\leq k_{i+1}^{j} \\textrm{ and } k_{i+1}^{j} \\leq k_{i}^{j} \\textrm{ then } k_{i}^{j}=k_{i+1}^{j} \\textrm{,}$$  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "$$\\textrm{if } k_{i}^{j} \\leq k_{i+1}^{j} \\textrm{ and } k_{i+1}^{j} \\leq k_{m}^{j} \\textrm{ then } k_{i}^{j}\\leq k_{m}^{j} \\textrm{,}$$  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "$$k_{i}^{j} \\leq k_{i}^{j} \\textrm{,}$$  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "$$k_{i}^{j} \\leq k_{i+1}^{j} \\textrm{.}$$  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Equations 6-9 define the antisymmetry (6), transitivity (7), reflexive (8) and totality properties (9) respectively. To apply an ordering we require a numerical value per source, that satisfies these properties. This can be obtained by measuring the angular separation $\\theta$, between each known source, and a single reference coordinate ($00^h$ $00^m$ $00^s$ and $00^{\\circ}$ $00^\\prime$ $00^{\\prime\\prime}$). This allows sources to be strictly ordered according to their separation from the reference point.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "For each candidate source, the same reference separation is computed. Intuitively known sources near to the candidate $c_i$ would appear to be similarly separated from the reference point. The reality is more nuanced. It is possible for sources to be similarly separated from the reference point, yet be very far apart (see the accompanying paper Lyon & Stappers, 2017). Fortunately this does not affect matching accuracy when using the new approach. The sorting of known sources is only used to *reduce* the search space. It allows us to find a position from where to start searching in $K$. We call this position the search 'index'. From there, we need only compare $c_i$ to sources in $K$ around the search index, with separations $\\leq 2\\theta$ with respect to the reference point. These sources must be adjacent to the search index given the properties of the ordering.  \n",
    "<br>  \n",
    "The full algorithm is presented below (**Matcher.py**). It is accompanied by several utility classes, some of which are presented first. Note that the provided code is written for Python 2.7. The original SDP prototype code was written in Java. However we ported it to Python, as most software used in the radio astronomy community is python based. Unit testing code is supplied at the end of this notebook, in the Appendix.\n",

Using a single known source to compare against, we generate candidate sources with the same position on the sky, but vary their period and DM. The algorithm should only match only those candidate sources which have the same period and DM to within some error margin. In many ways, this represents the worst case scenario for the mathcing algorithm, where there are many sources with the same on sky location to be compared."

    "### Sifting  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### Standard Off-line Sift\n",
    "Standard sift is an off-line matching problem. Given a fixed size set of tuples $C$, of length $n$, the goal is to remove duplicates contained in $C$. This produces a filtered set $C^\\prime$. To achieve the filtering some function $f$ is used. It is the case that $f$ will **never** return a set $C^\\prime$, such that $|C^\\prime| > |C|$. Rather it is **always** the case the $|C^\\prime| \\leq |C|$, though in reality $|C^{\\prime}| \\ll |C|$.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To perform the filtering, the function $f$ performs a matching operation over each tuple in $C$. An individual tuple is defined as $c_{i} = \\lbrace c_{i}^{1}, \\ldots , c_{i}^{m}\\rbrace$. A tuple is uniquely identifiable in $C$ via the index $i$, and for all $c_{i} \\in C$, $|c_{i}| > 0$ (in others words $m > 0$). We note that the set $C$ is not a multi-set, thus it does not contain any *identical* duplicate items. There are however non-exact duplicates. These must be removed with high accuracy, so that the size of the set $C^{\\prime}$ is minimised.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Sifting determines whether or not two arbitrary tuples are equivalent via a similarity measure $s$. The similarity measure is usually associated with some decision threshold value $t$, applied over one or more variables that make up a tuple. If the similarity value for two distinct tuples is above some threshold, these are considered a match. Otherwise tuples are considered disjoint.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using some basic probability theory, we can describe the goal for the function $f$ more clearly. Suppose $P(c_{i})$ is the prior probability of the tuple $c_{i}$ having a match in $C$. Now suppose $P(\\textrm{match} | c_{i})$, is the probability of a match, conditioned on $c_{i}$ (what is the chance of a match, given I've observed $c_{i}$). An optimal matching algorithm will do the following:  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$f(c_{i})=\\underset{\\textrm{label}\\in \\lbrace match,\\neg match\\rbrace}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(\\textrm{label}|c_{i}),$$  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "which says $f(c_{i})$ chooses the label that maximises the probability $P(\\textrm{label}|c_{i})$ (picks the most likely label). A function that does this well, will achieve a very high accuracy level. However matching is not usually done in an explicitly probabilistic way for practical reasons. Generally heuristics over key variables (e.g. DM, period, acceleration etc) are used to constrain the matching via thresholds. Nonetheless, any threshold choice is effectively a probabilistic proxy, chosen to maximise $P(\\textrm{label}|c_{i})$.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, suppose we use a simple similarity measure $s_{1}$. Imagine that it considers $c_{i}$ and $c_{k}$ duplicates, if their DM values are within $t/2$ of one another (assuming $T$ could be used in this way!). For this test, there are underlying probability distributions. There is a distribution describing the probability of an arbitrary DM being considered the same as the DM of $c_{i}$, and the same goes for  $c_{k}$. This is shown below (below the code)."

    "These distributions can be used in principle, to estimate the probability of a value randomly falling in a predefined range. You can compute the joint probability $P(\\textrm{DM in 68\\% interval for } c_{i}) \\times P(\\textrm{DM in 68\\% interval for } c_{k})$, and use that to estimate the similarity.

    "The current 'best' approach does a brute force comparison of each $c_{i}$, to every $c_{k}$ according to $s$. This has a memory complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ given that all $n$ candidates must be stored in memory. Run time is typically $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$, quadratic complexity. We note that minor adjustments to the brute force approach can yield better runtime performance, e.g. simply by realising that a decreasing number of comparisons only need be done (i.e. there are only so many unique comparison permutations). The total number of possible permutations for a set of length $n$, where $k$ items are compared at a time, is given by:  \n",

    "$$\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\cdot k!}$$  \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "$$ \\textrm{Permuations} =  \\frac{3!}{(3-2)! \\cdot 2!}$$  \n",
    "<br>\n",

    "$$ = \\frac{6}{1 \\cdot 2}$$  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{6}{2}$$  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$ = 3$$  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Technically speaking this approach is dominated by $\\mathcal{O}(n!)$ runtime complexity for all $k$. In practice, for $k=2$, it is dominated by $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{2}(n-1)n)$ (rearranged original formula assuming $k=2$). These two orders of complexity are compared below."

    "#### Streaming Sift Challenge\n",
    "The goal of streaming sift (on-line sift) is to match each $c_{i}$, when the the size of $C$ is unbounded (unknown $n$). Ideally streaming sift should i) return only those candidates which cannot be matched, and ii) limits the number of candidates returned for practical reasons to approximately $n_{matches}=1000$. This is difficult to do. The brute force approach becomes invalid, as the memory required to undertake streaming sift is unbounded. How then to compare each $c_{i} \\in C$, when given only $C^{\\prime\\prime} \\subset C$ to match against at any one time. The problem needs redefining slightly.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We suppose there is a computational system outputting elements from $C$ incrementally, according to some interval $t_{int}$. This interval may vary in size. However it will always be the case that candidates will arrive in a temporally ordered fashion, one at a time (discreet time model). We extend the notation used previously. Now $c_{i}$ is now the candidate arriving at time step $i$, and $c_{1}$ always arrives before $c_{2}$. The set of candidates $C$ can now be easily viewed as a stream containing $c_{1}$ to $c_{n}$.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We assume candidates output by the computational system will be ordered according to $c_{i}^{0}$ (the ordering variable). This ordering must be strict, so that $\\forall c_{i} \\in C$, $c_{i}^{0} \\leq c_{i+1}^{0}$. This definition specifies an ascending order, though it would make no difference if there were descending.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The stream we are dealing with also exhibits bursty behaviour. The system producing candidates will stop doing so for an intermittent period, before starting again at a later time. Only candidates arriving in the same burst should be considered for matching (analogous to an observation).  To capture this, we modify our streaming model slightly (this modification is fairly unique).   \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The modified goal for streaming sift is to remove duplicates occurring within the same burst $b$, such that for each burst, no more than $n_{matches}=1000$ are returned. We modify the notation $c_{i}$, so that $c_{ib}$ now identifies the burst a candidate belongs to, and to which its ordering applies (with $c_{ib}^{j}$ updated accordingly). To be clear, as the ordering is reset after each burst, $\\forall c_{ib}^{0} \\in C$, it cannot be assumed that $c_{ib}^{0} \\leq c_{i+1b+1}^{0}$ (the batches are not necessarily output in ascending order). Nor can it be assumed that $c_{ib}^{0} \\geq c_{i+1b+1}^{0}$ (no descending order either). The number of candidates in a burst is indeterminate, and will fluctuate over time.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To complicate matters, there may be more unique candidates in a burst than $n_{matches}$. Only the most promising candidates should be retained. Here 'promise' is indicated by some metric or characteristic (e.g. S/N) represented by $c_{ib}^{1}$ for convenience. As the most promising candidates can appear anywhere in a burst, and as there can be more than $n_{matches}$ such candidates, it is possible to miss out on these if they occur at the end of a burst.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is simply a consequence of choosing candidates too eagerly early on, leaving no room for other promising candidates. This trade-off is difficult to overcome. Especially as it is desirable for streaming sift to immediately flag highly promising candidates for further processing.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Next we look at two sifting variants that can be used to overcome these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed On-line Sift\n",
    "Distributed sift operates on one candidate at a time, as opposed to candidate batches. It's assumes an ordering over candidate pulse periods. Using this ordering, candidates can be partitioned by their pulse periods. This ensures that candidates with similar periods (i.e. more likely to be duplicates), can be grouped and processed together. A  frequency counting approach can be used to check for duplicates. The logic underpinning this approach is simple. If a period has been observed many times, it is a possible duplicate. When duplicates are compared via other variables (e.g. DM), frequency counting can be used to accurately find duplicates.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The general approach is is presented in the code below. It assumes a stream partitioning that ensures candidates with similar periods (measured in $\\mu$s) arrive at the same nodes."

    "#### Windowed Sift\n",
    "We have an outline design for a on-line 'windowed' sift algorithm. This algorithm begins the sifting process, by initialising some key variables:  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. A pool used to store promising candidates from a burst, which has a maximum size of $n_{matches}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A sliding window over the stream. This starts at the beginning of the burst. It ends at a location consistent where there is little or no chance of the example of at the start of the window, being related to the example at the end. This notion of likelihood will be captured by some statistical test. Over time the window will move according to the current $c_{i}$ being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A number of statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.1. a count of the examples observed in the burst so far.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.2. a count of the examples in the pool.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.3. a count of the examples in the pool passed on for further processing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.4. the current length of the sliding window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.5. a count of the probable duplicates found in the burst so far.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Following variable initialisation, there are two possible scenarios. In the first, the algorithm begins buffering a small number of candidates to construct the sliding window. The number of examples buffered depends on the metric used to determine the likelihood of similarity (between the example at the start of the window, and that at the end). This approach can waste time populating the buffer, but may lead to better results in the long run. It is also more complicated to implement. For example, once the first 50 examples have been buffered, you then have to go back to $c_{1}$, undertake comparisons, then do the same for $c_{2},\\ldots,c_{50}$.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The alternative approach is to not wait. Here we simply construct the window on the first example seen. The algorithm then attempts to match the first candidate to those stored in the window. As no other candidates will have been seen at this point, $c_{1}$ will be automatically assigned to the pool as a promising candidate, in absence of additional information.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "With no buffering, time is saved. However it is possible for this approach to lead to sub-optimal candidates being sent too early for further processing, as so few comparisons have taken place. To prevent this becoming a significant problem, a simple constraint can be applied. Simply ensure that at least $n_{min}$ candidates had been seen, before any are sent onwards.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This constraint achieves the same effect as buffering (a wait), though it is easier to implement. It should also be noted that in the stream mining domain more generally, a statistical test would be used to determine the appropriate number of candidates to observe, before allowing candidates to be forwarded on. This is typically controlled by a desired level of user confidence $\\delta \\in [0,1]$. A $\\delta = 0.95$ implies the user wants to be 95% confident, that enough examples have been observed.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However the initialisation of the window is done, each subsequent candidate that arrives, will be compared to those in the current sliding window. If there is a match between $c_{i}$ and $c_{i+1}$ in the window, and $c_{i+1}$ has the best $c_{ib}^{1}$, it will be compared to those in the pool. If there is a match in the pool, then the best match will be retained in the pool, and the other discarded. If the candidate is deemed very promising according to some heuristic $h$, then it will be immediately sent for further processing, and the appropriate counts updated. The pool will also be decreased in length by 1, with the sent candidate retained for further burst comparisons. If the pool is full when this occurs, the least promising candidate in the pool has to be discarded to enable the pool to shrink.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In principle this approach would appear to be sound. Provided the window is large enough, you could always compare similar candidates to one another. This should enable the fast identification of matches. There are obviously lots of implementation specific details not considered here. Those are not a concern right now, as we think about this as a proof of concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stream Windowing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible ways to construct a window. Either incrementally, or in a single go based on a buffer of observed examples. There are actually three general models for this (Wu & Chen, 2006):  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. A landmark data model - this considers the data in the stream from the start until 'now'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A sliding window model - this considers the data from 'now', up to a certain point/range in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A damped window model - this associates weights with the stream data, and gives higher weights to more recent data.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Our window is considered to be a time-based landmark window (see Pramod & Vyas, 2012).  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are other general methods. One of the more popular is **ADWIN** (Bifet & Gavaldà, 2007). **ADWIN** maintains a single sliding window $W$ over a data stream. The window is actually made up of sub-windows $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ (though more windows can be used!). As data moves through $W$, the respective means and variances of the sub-windows are computed. A statistical equality test is then done on these values, and a probabilistic estimate of similarity obtained. If the respective means and variances of the sub-windows are different, then this is interpreted to mean there has been a significant distributional shift in $W$. Thus the older portion of the window is dropped.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based upon this approach, I've devised a potentially useful strategy. The code below describes this method. It is based on a basic queue, assuming the first in, first out principle (FIFO). It maintains both window and stream statistics, and accepts user parameters. \n",
